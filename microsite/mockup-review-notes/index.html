    <h1>Mockup Review</h1>
    <p>We're both leaning towards the Mockup A that looks like a tech website. I think the font family and colors are fitting. I especially like the way the navigation bar looks. We talked about how we could improve the placement of the animation.</p>

    <p>One of the big struggles that we're having with this idea is the lack of imagery associated with the topic (my fault, sorry). We brainstormed some type as expression ideas together: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>randomized letters/other elements to emulate the sorting algorithm</li>
        <li>background texture with some unsorted something and color to indicate final sorted version</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're also finding that the website is really text-heavy. I don't mind if Arianna ends up cutting text out. However, we had a conversation with James and Abe and they directed us to the "Zero" website again to figure out how to abstract information and reduce text.</p>

    <p>They also recommended different ideas that we could try, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>deck of cards metaphor</li>
        <li>experimenting with title treatment, flipping through different spellings etc.. until landing on right one (I like this as a landing page animation)</li>
        <li>comical approach: looking at oatmeal.com or xkcd</li>
        <li>give it comic strip feeling with characters reacting to absurdity of algorithm</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We briefly looked at Mockup B, but we both decided that it was in the wrong direction. We did not discuss it extensively.</p>
