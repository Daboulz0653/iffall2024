Her designs later became more romantic, with the incorporation of renaissance paintings, corsetry and structured garments, and exxagerated silhouttes. In the 2000s, Westwood picked up on environmental activism, and many of her designs began to feature political slogans. Look below for a gallery of some of her most famous looks:

                    In a tribute on her Instagram following the death of Westwood, Bella Hadid wrote: “From the first day I met you to the last day I saw you, you made me smile, listen, learn and love more than the day before. I will forever be grateful to have been in your orbit, because to me and most , in fashion & in humanity, you, Vivienne, were the sun.”</p>
