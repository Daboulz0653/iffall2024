            Westwood was born in Hollingworth, Cheshire,[11][12] on 8 April 1941.[13][14] She grew up in nearby Tintwistle, and was the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (n√©e Ball), who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War.[15] At the time of Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously worked as a greengrocer.[15]

            In 1958, her family moved to Harrow, Greater London. Westwood took a jewellery and silversmith course at the University of Westminster, then known as the Harrow Art School,[16] but left after one term, saying: "I didn't know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world".[17] After taking a job in a factory and studying at a teacher-training college, she became a primary-school teacher. During this period, she created her own jewellery, which she sold at a stall on Portobello Road.[14]

            In 1962, she met Derek Westwood, an apprentice at the Hoover factory, in Harrow.[18] They married on 21 July 1962; Westwood made her own wedding dress.[18] In 1963, she gave birth to a son, Benjamin.[18]
