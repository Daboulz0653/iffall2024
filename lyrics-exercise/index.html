            <h1>Shape of My Heart</h1>
            <h3>STING</h3>
            <br>
            
            <p>He deals the cards as a meditation</p>
            <p>And those he plays never suspect</p>
            <p>He doesn't play for the money he wins</p>
            <p>He don't play for respect</p>
            <br>
            <p>He deals the cards to find the answer</p>
            <p>The sacred geometry of chance</p>
            <p>The hidden law of a probable outcome</p>
            <p>The numbers lead a dance</p>
            <br>
            <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier</p>
            <p>I know that the clubs are weapons of war</p>
            <p>I know that diamonds mean money for this art</p> 
            <p>But that's not the shape of my heart</p>
            <br>
            <p>He may play the jack of diamonds</p>
            <p>He may lay the queen of spades</p>
            <p>He may conceal a king in his hand</p>
            <p>While the memory of it fades</p>
            <br>
            <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier</p>
            <p>I know that the clubs are weapons of war</p>
            <p>I know that diamonds mean money for this art</p>
            <p>But that's not the shape of my heart</p>
            <p>That's not the shape</p>
            <p>The shape of my heart</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I told her that I loved you</p>
            <p>You'd maybe think there's something wrong</p>
            <p>I'm not a man of too many faces</p>
            <p>The mask I wear is one</p>
            <br>
            <p>But those who speak know nothing</p>
            <p>And find out to their cost</p>
            <p>Like those who curse their luck in too many places</p>
            <p>And those who fear are lost</p>
            <br>
            <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier</p>
            <p>I know that the clubs are weapons of war</p>
            <p>I know that diamonds mean money for this art</p>
            <p>But that's not the shape of my heart</p>
            <p>That's not the shape of my heart</p>
            <p>That's not the shape</p>
            <p>The shape of my heart</p>
